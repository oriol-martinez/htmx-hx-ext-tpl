# hx-take
## Version 0.3.0
# 🚧⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️🚧

This version is on development. Documentation needs to be remade, even the name has changed!

An **[htmx](https://htmx.org/essays/#memes)** extension that allows to select and swap existing elements on the DOM.

## Found a bug?
Yeah, I thought so. You can open an issue or try a pull request and we can figure it out together.

## What is with the code of this? It sucks!
It's written in ES5 JavaScript like htmx (1.9.x), the bulk of the code is a modified version of the swap function(s) of htmx. If you don't like it help me improve it, don't watch or go [elsewhere](https://react.dev/).
